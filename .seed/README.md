# CODINGAME seed

A vanilla JavaScript starter using [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for packing multiple files into a single file that you can use on [CODINGAME](https://www.codingame.com/)




## Setup & Build

To get started clone this repo and run

```bash
  npm install
```

Import all files into /src/main.js file, this file is the entry point. 
Use anywhere in your project the @ alias on your imports to refer to the root directory(./src)

To build and merge all your files run:

```bash
  npm run build
```

The generated file is located in dist directory. Setup *emptyOutDir: true* in *vite.config.js* if you want this folder to be emptied prior to future builds.
